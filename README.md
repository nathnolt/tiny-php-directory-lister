# tiny-php-directory-lister

It's all self contained in the 1 PHP file, and should work on any modern php version.

I intended its use for if you have a project with like static files, and you want to add a simple directory lister so you can always find your way. This program does not have any limit set though, so any folder PHP can read, you can browse to.
