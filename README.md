# tiny PHP directory lister

It's all self contained in the 1 PHP file, and should work on any modern php version.

## features
- breadcrumb menu
- directory listing
- icon to indicate whether the item is a directory or a file


I intended its use for if you have a project with like static files, and you want to add a simple directory lister so you can always find your way. This program does not have any limit set though, so any folder PHP can read, you can browse to.
