## Features
- breadcrumb menu
- directory listing
- icon to indicate whether the item is a directory or a file
- very small: less than 7kb
- single PHP file
- simple instalation

## Installation

Place the php file into a directory and you're done

## Settings

Currently there is 1 setting, which is called parentScopeLimit (standard set to true)

If set to true, this prevents people from traversing upwards relative to ./ and see all the files in your domain.
