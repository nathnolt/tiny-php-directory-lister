# tiny-php-directory-lister

It's all self contained in the 1 PHP file, and should work on any modern php version.

I intended its use for if you have a project with like static files, and you want to add a simple directory lister so you can always find your way. This program does not have any limit set though, so any file PHP can read, you can browse too. But feel free to look at the code and add this functionality in.
