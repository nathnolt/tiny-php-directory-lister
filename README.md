## features
- breadcrumb menu
- directory listing
- icon to indicate whether the item is a directory or a file
- very small: less than 7kb
- single PHP file
- simple instalation

## installation

Place the php file into a directory and you're done

## my intent

I intended it for use in localhost or simmilar setting, where it doesn't matter if a client can see all the contents of your directories and can move up beyond the project scope. That's why limits haven't been implemented yet.
